Objective:

The objective of this project is to perform Python Program to manage inventory for a store or warehouse. The system should
allow users to add, edit, and delete products, track inventory levels, and generate reports
such as low- stock alerts or sales summaries. Implement features like user authentication,
data validation, and graphical user interface (GUI) for better usability.


Key Activities:

1. User Authentication: Implementing user registration and login functionality with password hashing.
2. Product Management: Creating, reading, updating, and deleting (CRUD) product information.
3. Reporting: Generating reports on low-stock products.
4. Data Storage: Storing user and product data in a JSON file.


Technologies Used:

1. Python
2. Tkinter: A Python library used for creating the graphical user interface (GUI).
3. JSON: A lightweight data interchange format used for storing user and product data.
4. Hashlib: A Python library used for password hashing.


Features:

1. User Registration: Users can register with a username and password.
2. Login: Registered users can log in to the system.
3. Product Management: Users can add, edit, remove, and view products.
4. Reporting: Users can generate reports on low-stock products.
5. Data Validation: The system validates user input to ensure data consistency.


Key Insights:

1. Security: The system uses password hashing to secure user passwords.
2. Data Storage: The system uses a JSON file to store user and product data, making it easy to manage and update.
3. User Experience: The system provides a simple and intuitive GUI for users to interact with.
4. Scalability: The system can be easily scaled to accommodate more users and products.
